# Retro Vocabulary Trainer

A retro-styled vocabulary trainer built with **pure PHP** and **TailwindCSS**.

- **Quizzes**: Self-test with rounds that adapt to word "strength" (untested â†’ mastered).
- **Spaced Repetition**: Automatic scheduling of next reviews based on performance.
- **Statistics**: Track progress, distribution of word strengths, sessions played, and review status per language.
- **Authentication**: User registration, login, and session handling.
- **Validation & Sanitization**: Secure handling of inputs to maintain data integrity.
- **Retro Styling**: Clean, nostalgic interface powered by TailwindCSS.

## Tech Stack
